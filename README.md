# Monte Carlo simulation of mortgage loan
In this repository a Monte Carlo simulation for a non fixed interest mortgage loan is done.
The main aiming is to get the distribution of the new mortgage payment after fixing of currently unknown interest.
The calculation of the interest is based on a currently unknown zero coupon yield curve
